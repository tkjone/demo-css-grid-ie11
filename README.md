# DEMO - CSS GRID IE11

I am interested in seeing how much of CSS we can use of CSS Grid and still have it work on IE11. This will build out a basic app shell with a table as the main content.

Illustrating:

- App Structure
- Main content scrollable - to access the main content
- Popovers not anchored to the bottom of the screen
- Remove overflow: hidden

# TODO

- [ ] content area organized via columns + grid gap
- [ ] demo popover

# Quickstart

To test this, you can run the `index.html` file in the browser, but you will also need to run IE11 on your local environment. To do this, I run a VM. What follows are the steps to get the VM running on your local machine.
